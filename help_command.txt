exit             Exit Simuino

proj <name>      Read project configuration  		 
                 Do enter "load" to load project

load <steps>     Load current project and
                 create scenario of length <steps>
                 if no parameters, <steps> are as configured

list             List available projects. 
                 Selected is marked with '>'

<n>              Select project according to number in list

run <steps>      Step until step=<steps>
                 If no steps given - enter Run Mode

loop <loop>      Step until loop <loop>

reset            Reset simulation. Current step set to 0

save  <name>     Save current project as <name>
                 If no <name>, saved to current project

del   <name>     Delete project. If no parameter,
                 current project will be deleted.
                 Default project cannot be deleted.

add   <...>      Add pin-value-point in scenario
                 Ex. add a 3 100 650
                 Analog Pin 3 will read values 650 
                 from step 100 and forward.

rem   <...>	 Remove pin-value-point in scenario
                 Ex. rem d 7 50
                 Digital Pin 7 will no longer read values
                 specified at step 50
